# Breath Intelligence Visualizer — Multi-Mode Concept Demo

This is a front-end only concept demo showing a synthetic breathing cycle visualized through multiple modes:

- Coherence Mode
- Earth Mode
- Eclipse Mode
- Group Field Mode

It uses **no real data** and contains **no proprietary analytics or signal processing** — only timing, CSS, and simple JavaScript state changes.

## Running

- Open `index.html` in a browser, or
- Deploy via GitHub Pages using the repo root as the Pages source.
